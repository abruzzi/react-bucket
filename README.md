# React Bucket

## Installation

Run the following commands to start the server

```sh
npm install
npm start
```

If you want to work in the local environment

```sh
$ #start mock server on 8080 first
$ npm start:mock
```

The server is listening at ```http://localhost:1337```

## Build a package

```sh
npm run build
```

This will generate some files under folder `dist/`, and it has been ignored of course
in file `.gitignore`.
